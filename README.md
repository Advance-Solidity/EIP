# ZkSync

Short for zero-knowledge (zk), zkSync is a network that offloads Ethereum's network traffic and relieves the mainnet of congestion and high transfer fees. Because zkSync's existence is so tied to Ethereum, it is often called a Layer 2 scalability solution, whereas Ethereum itself is a Layer 1 network.
